## Description
        The purpose of this challenge is to illustrate the importance of semantics and accessibilty in code. A webpage can look aesthetically pleasing, but if it's code isn't up to snuff it could become a chore for users to navigate. In this project the task was given to update an existing site and improve its' overall accessibility.
        The first step in achieving this goal was replacing the site's existing HTML with Semantic HTML. This process helped make the code easier to read and provide accurate locations for the HTML elements. The website also given an updated name to increase search engine optimization, making it easier to find using sites like Google and Yahoo. 
        The site's styling was also tweaked. The style sheet was condensed to make the code more efficient and scale back any uncessary repitition.
